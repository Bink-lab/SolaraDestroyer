# Solara Destroyer

I have made this program to find the Solara files stored somewhere random on your PC, this fucking retarded ratted ass roblox executor needs to get spanked out of existance.

There are lots of spelling mistakes cuz i cant bother to fix them but ay it works.

## Usage

Either use the .exe file or the .py file included in the [Releases](github.com/Bink-lab/SolaraDestroyer/releases) tab.

For the .exe
- Download it from the [releases](github.com/Bink-lab/SolaraDestroyer/releases)
- Run the program (Use administrator if you want to automatically remove the files)

For the .py
- I think the dependancies are already installed if u have python if not thats not my problem
- U cant run it as administrator so just press 'y' when prompted
